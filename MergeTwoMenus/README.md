## Requirement
- A waitress of Pancake House keeps a breakfast menu which uses an ArrayList to hold its menu items.
- And a waitress of Diner keeps a lunch menu which uses an array to hold its menu items.
- Now, these two restaurants are merged and intend to provide services in one place, so a waitress should keep both menus in hands.
